**Movie Recommendation System**

This project uses the **TMDB 5000** Movie Dataset to build a movie recommendation system. The system implements content-based filtering to suggest movies similar to a user's previous choices.

**Key Features**:
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset by extracting and processing important features like genres, vote averages, and popularity.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visual insights into the data, helping to understand the distribution of key features.
**Recommendation Engine**: Utilizes content-based filtering to compute movie similarities based on genres, ratings, and other relevant features.
**User Interaction**: Allows users to input a movie title and receive a list of similar movies as recommendations.
The system is designed to help users discover new movies based on their past preferences.
